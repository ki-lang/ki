# Ki (Discontinued)

New project: [Valk Programming Language](https://github.com/valk-lang/valk)

Ki was discontinued because it wasnt what we wanted it to be. Our main goals were speed & simplicity. We managed to make the language very fast, but it didnt have the simplicity we wanted it to have. At best, it was a rust alternative. But why build another rust? So we gave up on the ki-project. We were stuck between believing that you need GC to keep things simple and that GCs are slow. Months after closing this project, we were curious if we could build a fast GC language. We were expecting something between rust & go. Well.. We found out we could build a GC and be FASTER than rust.. That project is Valk and it is everything what we wanted to achieve with ki.

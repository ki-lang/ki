# Ki

[Website](https://ki-lang.dev) | [Documentation](https://ki-lang.dev/docs) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/T7pR6fm6SC)

(We are still in alpha, the standard lib still needs alot of work)

ki is a type safe compiled language designed to be fast and easy to use. It does not have any garbage collection and instead uses ownership combined with minimal ref counting to manage memory. Alternatively you can manage your own memory using 'struct' instead of 'class'. We also allow you to compile from any platform to any platform out-of-the-box. We have generics. We have 'null' but runtime null errors do not exist. We have an awesome way to return/handle errors. Our compile times are much faster than other language (and we havent optimized it yet). We use LLVM as a back-end, so all your release code will be super optimized. We are also working on a fast/simple/versioned package manager.

Goals: fast run / compile times âš¡ simplicity and great package management ðŸ“¦

## Compatibility

## How to install

```
curl -s https://ki-lang.dev/dist/install.sh | bash -s latest
```

More info:  [Install docs](https://ki-lang.dev/docs/dev/install)

## Basic usage

```bash
# ki -h for help
ki build src/*.ki -o hello
./hello
```

## Example code

```js
func main() void {
    println("Hello world!");
}
```

## Build from source (Linux / macOS / WSL)

macOS: `brew install llvm@15 && brew link llvm@15`

Linux: install `llvm-15`, Ubuntu/debian see: [apt.llvm.org](https://apt.llvm.org/)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ki-lang/ki.git
cd ki
make
```

## Build from source (Windows)

You can build it natively, but you need the LLVM modules which LLVM does not provide with their installer. We do have our own LLVM builds which you can find in the dist/toolchains.sh script. If you want a simple setup, you can use msys2 (mingw) setup.

install msys2 & open the terminal

```bash
pacman -S --needed git wget mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake make mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 autoconf libtool
pacman -S lld
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-llvm
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-clang

git clone https://github.com/ki-lang/ki.git
cd ki
make
```

## Known issues

- Compiling for macos from linux works but seems to crash sometimes with illegal hardware instruction
